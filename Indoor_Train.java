//This activity can be accessed by ALL other activities. First of all it loads the floorplan of TLG
//on the map (just once) adn then measures the number of reference points (if there are any, because the
//user might have deleted them all or the database might have not been created yet). Then a marker
//for EACH REFERENCE POINT is added on the map (on the location that each reference point was captured).
//Moreover the user can press on the map and then the latitude and longitude coordinates of the point
//that he/she just pressed are displayed in TexViews on top of the map. Then by pressing the start
//button a marker is added for that reference point and the storing process begins (we store MAC addresses
// for the reference point). Please refer to Programmer's Guide for visualising that. By placing a marker
//for each stored reference point the user has the ability at ANY TIME (after closing for example
// the app and then reopening it) to delete
// ANY of the reference points by simply clicking on a marker representing a reference point
//and pressing "Delete ref point". Finally at each marker (thus, at EACH REFERENCE POINT and
// NOT in any other point on the map) the user can press the camera button and after granting storage
//permission a photo can be taken FOR ANY reference point which are then being displayed
// during indoor positioning on an ImageView as explained in the Indoor_Positioning activity. Note that
//if the user tries to capture a photo at any other point in the map (which is not a reference point)
//then an appropriate message is displayed.
// The photos are being stored inside a folder named "Reference points" in the internal deviceâ€™s Camera/Pictures folder
// and if the user deletes any of the photos inside this folder then the app will understand that
// and during positioning phase it will simply not display the image of that reference point as it does
//not exist anymore.
